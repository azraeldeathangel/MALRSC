# Maldev Roadmap

This repository serves as a personal guide to learning malware development, reverse engineering, and foundational low-level systems knowledge. It combines core computer science, practical debugging, binary exploitation, and Windows internals.

---

## Computer Science Fundamentals

* How computers work
* Numeric systems (binary, hex, decimal)
* How memory and CPU work

  * Reference: [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)
* High-level understanding of machine code

---

## Low-Level Concepts

* Obfuscation, encryption, decryption, and common algorithms
* x64 Assembly

  * TryHackMe
  * [post2](https://p.ost2.dev)
  * [Godbolt Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
* Learn to use debuggers (e.g., x64dbg)

---

## Windows Internals

* Use **Windows Internals Part 1** as a reference

  * Start with the first three chapters:

    * Processes
    * Handles
    * Threads

---

## Tips for Reimplementing Malware

* Read and analyze malware source code:

  * What is being performed?
  * How is it being performed?
  * Are there alternative techniques?
  * Can we replicate the API usage?
