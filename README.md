# MRASC – Malware Research and Study Collection
A curated roadmap and resource archive for learning malware development, reverse engineering, and low-level system concepts. Whether you're aiming to analyze malware, develop offensive tooling, or understand the system from the inside out, this collection gives you a solid foundation and learning path.

## Computer Science Fundamentals
* How computers work
* Numeric systems (binary, hex, decimal)
* How memory and CPU work
  * Reference: [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)
* High-level understanding of machine code

## Low-Level Concepts
* Obfuscation, encryption, decryption, and common algorithms
* x64 Assembly

  * TryHackMe
  * [Godbolt Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
* Learn to use debuggers (e.g., x64dbg)

## Windows Internals
* Use **Windows Internals Part 1** as a reference
  * Start with the first three chapters:

    * Processes
    * Handles
    * Threads

## Malware Source Code Analysis
* What is being performed?
* How is it being performed?
* Are there alternative techniques?
* Can we replicate the API usage?

## Reverse Engineering and Pwn
### Foundational Learning
* [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/) - Hands-on platform for learning memory corruption, shellcoding, and RE fundamentals.
* [Z0F Reverse Engineering Course](https://www.debugxp.com/posts/RECourse/) - A Windows-focused RE course with tools like x64dbg, PE-bear, and Ghidra. Includes crackmes and guided labs.
* [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/00-intro/index.html) - A Linux-based binary exploitation and RE tutorial series focused on memory bugs and control flow.
